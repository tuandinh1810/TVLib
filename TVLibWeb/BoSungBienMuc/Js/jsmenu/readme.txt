The Milonic DHTML Menu is a feature rich, cross browser DHTML website navigation 
system.

Several years of constant development have created one of the best website 
navigation systems currently available. The main use of the DHTML Menu is to 
allow for single click navigation of websites, Intranets, Extranets, and CD-ROMS. 
Normally navigation is from within a home page, but can be from anywhere within 
either the user's website or from another website on the Internet. Object 
oriented menu data definition files assist in easy modification of custom 
menus. This allows for menus to be built easily from databases or XML.

+--------------+ 
| Installation | 
+--------------+                                                                                   

Installation is very easy, but there are a few traps that you'll need to watch 
out for. More details on installing the menu can be found in the INSTALL file.



+---------------+ 
| Example usage | 
+---------------+                                                                                   

All menus are built using the default menu_data.js file that accompanies this 
download. This is the file you will edit in order to build and design your menu 
for your own website or Intranet, etc. We recommend a good quality plain text 
editor. Notepad will work but does have issues.



+-------+ 
| Notes | 
+-------+                                                                                   

Menus that are too long for the browser window will be given scroll bars to 
assist in creating a viewable area, even though the menu would have been hidden. 
Delayed menu opening enables the menu to operate more accurately and appear to 
function in the same way as conventional menus on most operating systems. Every 
aspect of the menu can be modified both at runtime and build-time.

| What Is JavaScript? | 
+---------------------+                                                                                   

JavaScript is Netscape's cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
Core JavaScript contains a core set of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, 
and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and 
statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by 
supplementing it with additional objects; for example:



+------------------------+ 
| Client-Side JavaScript | 
+------------------------+                                                                                   

Web browsers such as Navigator (2.0 and later versions) can interpret client-
side JavaScript statements embedded in an HTML page. When the browser (or 
client) requests such a page, the server sends the full content of the document, 
including HTML and JavaScript statements, over the network to the client. The 
browser reads the page from top to bottom, displaying the results of the HTML 
and executing JavaScript statements as they are encountered.
