+--------------+                                                                            

1.	Read all the README files noted in the INTRODUCTION section of the README 
	file.

2.	Copy the files mmenudom.js, mmenuns4.js, milonic_src.js and menu_data.js 
	to your web server. You can put these in a directory if you like but you 
	will need to add details of your directory to the code in section 3 below.

3.	Inform your web pages that you want the menu to appear when they are loaded. 
	To do this, you need to add the following JavaScript tags to your HTML page:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="milonic_src.js"></script>	
	<script	type="text/javascript">
	<!-- 
	if(ns4)_d.write("<script language=JavaScript src=mmenuns4.js><\/script>");		
	  else _d.write("<script language=JavaScript src=mmenudom.js><\/script>"); 
	 -->
	</script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="menu_data.js"></script>		

	The position of the above is not particularly important, but it's advisable to 
	place these tags just after the <BODY> tag or in the <HEAD> of your document. 
	This help minimize the risk of a conflict with other objects. The order in which 
	the tags appear IS important, and must be as shown above.

4.	Load up your page with your web browser. If all is well, the menu should 
	appear. If not, go through the README again and ensure that all actions have 
	been taken before you contact us.

5.	Once you are happy that the menu is working, you can begin modifying the 
	menu_data.js file and modify the existing objects to suit your own 
	requirements.
